# Instantiation Operations
We introduce herein a set of instantiation operations to represent the mapping relationship between concepts found at the process perspective, to concepts found at the project perspective, thus allowing process and project reconciliation.

\textbf{Name:} \texttt{Link}
\medskip

\textbf{Operation:} task.createLink (iteration: Iteration, instance: Instance, 
project: Project, processActivity: Activity)
\medskip

\textbf{Description:} Establishes a link between one process activity and a single task of the project plan. The task must have the same name as the associated process activity. 
\medskip

\textbf{Motivation:} Software process activities defined for the project are instantiated, but the lack of mapping between the process and the project plan makes it difficult to extract information from the process. Creating tasks with the same name as the corresponding activity, helps reducing the gap.
\medskip

\textbf{Applicability:} This operation applies to the situation in which you want to create a task in the project plan equal to the activity foreseen in the defined software process. In this situation, the foreseen activity meets the needs in its description and purpose. This operation creates a task in the project plan with the same process activity name and records the activity of the reference process.
\medskip

\textbf{Participants:} Activity: Software process activity defined for the project and Task: Project task present in the project plan.
\medskip

\textbf{Relation:} one to one between Activity and Task. \medskip

\textbf{Pseudocode:}

\lstset{language=Pascal, basicstyle=\small}  
\begin{lstlisting}
function task.createLink (iteration: Iteration, instance: Instance, 
project: Project, processActivity: Activity)
begin
    self.iteration = iteration
    self.instance = instance
    self.project = project
    self.processActivity = processActivity
    self.name = processActivity.name
    self.defineTask(ask_description, task_startDateForeseen, task_endtDateForeseen)

    return task
end

define_task(task_description, task_startDateForeseen, task_endtDateForeseen)
begin
    self.task_description = task_description
    self.task_startDateForeseen = task_startDateForeseen
    self.task_endDateForeseen = task_endDateForeseen
    self.task_task_status = "to_do"
end
\end{lstlisting}
